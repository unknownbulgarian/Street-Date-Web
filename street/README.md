## What is StreetDate ?

This became very popular in Germany. Basically, two people cannot see each other until they have answered the other person's three questions. In the end, they can see each other and must say if they are interested in the other.

### Who started it ?

Blind dates originally came from America. It was mostly the big YouTube content creators who started it. But the blind dates usually took place in special studios and people had to apply for them. After a while, people in Germany started arranging blind dates on the street.

There was one thing I never understood, why nobody did this thing online.

## For Nerds ðŸ¤“

For a smoother experience, I used logic on the client side most of the time.

So basically lets say I got the addLike function to increase the total likes of the posts, I would have to pull up the back end to get the likes for the targeted posts

But why should I get every single like again? Instead, I first render everything on the client with client-side functions, so if someone likes it, it will call the addLocalLike function, so that way I don't need to pull all the likes again on the back end.



# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
